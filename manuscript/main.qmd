# Introduction (700 words)

-   Could flat, unimodal and bimodal type gradients be observed
    depending on model choice?
-   Is there a temporal relationship?

# Materials and Methods (600 words)

## Occurrence data

<!-- Download data -->

`r ddate <- format(file.info("../data/raw/pbdb_data.RDS")$ctime, format = "%B %d %Y")`
<!-- Palaeoverse version -->
`r palaeoverse_ver <- packageVersion("palaeoverse")`
<!-- Analysis options --> `r source("../R/options.R")`
<!-- Number of occurrences -->
`r n_occ <- format(nrow(readRDS("../data/processed/pbdb_data.RDS")), big.mark = ",")`
<!-- Number of collections -->
`r n_coll <- format(length(unique(readRDS("../data/processed/pbdb_data.RDS")$collection_no)), big.mark = ",")`

We downloaded Fortunian--Piacenzian (541--0 Ma) fossil occurrence data
from the Paleobiology Database (PBDB; <https://paleobiodb.org/>) for
five major marine invertebrate groups (Bivalvia, Brachiopoda,
Cephalopoda, Gastropoda, Trilobita) on `r ddate`. Fossil occurrence data
were downloaded using the PBDB API service and were restricted to marine
environments, valid taxa and regular preservation (i.e. excluding form
taxa and ichnotaxa). Occurrence data were subsequently binned into
stratigraphic time bins following the Geological Timescale 2020
[@gradstein2020]. To do so, we used the bin_time() function from the
palaeoverse R package ver. `r palaeoverse_ver` using the 'majority'
approach [@jones2023]. Subsequently, we removed all occurrences with
less than `r params$threshold`% of their age range covered by their
assigned bin. After data preparation, the occurrence dataset contained
`r n_occ` occurrences, from `r n_coll` collections.

## Palaeogeographic reconstruction and binning

To reconstruct the palaeogeographic distribution of fossil occurrences,
we used their present-day distribution and the midpoint age from their
assigned temporal bin with three Global Plate Models: PALEOMAP
[@scotese2018], GOLONKA [@wright2013], and MERDITH2021 [@merdith2021].
Palaeorotations were implemented via the GPlates Web Service
(<https://gwsdoc.gplates.org>) using the palaeorotate() function in
palaeoverse ver. `r palaeoverse_ver` [@jones2023]. Subsequently, fossil
occurrences were binned into one of twelve equal-area latitudinal bins
(assuming a spherical Earth with a mean radius of \~6,371 km) using the
palaeolatitudes estimated by each Global Plate Model.

## Quantifying the latitudinal biodiveristy gradient

-   Metrics used to quantify the gradient

# Results (500 words)

-   Summary of reconstructions (could all points be reconstructed for
    each model?)
-   Summary of results from metrics, do different gradients emerge?

# Discussion (700 words)

-   Recap on importance of GPMs for deep time macroecology?
-   What have we shown?
-   Are some times or areas more problematic than others?
-   Importance for other fields beyond palaeobiology?
-   Consider importance of GPM choice in future work... or not?
