# Introduction (700 words)

* Could flat, unimodal and bimodal type gradients be observed depending on model choice?
* Is there a temporal relationship?

# Materials and Methods (600 words)

## Occurrence data

* What data was used
* How was it prepared

## Palaeogeographic reconstruction

* Which models were used and details
* How were they implemented

## Quantifying the latitudinal biodiveristy gradient

* Metrics used to quantify the gradient

# Results (500 words)

* Summary of reconstructions (could all points be reconstructed for each model?)
* Summary of results from metrics, do different gradients emerge?

# Discussion (700 words)

* Recap on importance of GPMs for deep time macroecology?
* What have we shown? 
* Are some times or areas more problematic than others?
* Importance for other fields beyond palaeobiology?
* Consider importance of GPM choice in future work... or not?
