# Supplementary Text

Here, we test the sensitivity of deep-time Latitudinal Biodiversity Gradient (LBG) reconstructions to the use of different Global Plate Models (GPMs).

GPMs use the Euler Rotation Theorem to reconstruct the motion of tectonic plates on a sphere-like structure–-the Earth. Based on a compilation of geological data (see [@seton2023] for an extensive review), a GPM divides tectonic plates into smaller sub-units that will move relatively to each other in a hierarchical way. It therefore takes two main inputs: (1) a set of tectonic elements and (2) a tree-like structured framework in which these elements moved throughout geological times, called reference frame [@seton2023; @verard_plate_2019; @ross_hierarchical_1988]. Two classes of GPMs exist. On the one hand, ‘Continental drift’ models aim at reconstructing the motion of present-day continental areas--discontinuous subset of rigid plates--as if they were 'floating' on the mantle [e.g. @wright2013; @scotese2018]. On the other hand ‘full-plates’ model describe in detail how plate borders have evolved through geological times [e.g. @gurnis_plate_2012; @seton2012], therefore tackling the issue from a more mechanistic perspective. Latest models of this class also allow for plate deformation while moving [e.g. @gurnis2018global; @muller2019global].

Many of the GPMs released so far are freely available via open-source platforms, such as GPlates [@boyden2011next]. However, in the face of such an easy access, it becomes important for users to bear in mind that GPMs have been developed for a variety of purposes, and are not necessarily showing the same thing altogether. While models using a palaeomagnetic reference frame provide actual palaeolatitude estimates, those using a mantle reference frame have been built to study the plate-mantle system and should not be used to get palaeocoordinates [@seton2023].

We therefore chose three mantle reference frame models.
