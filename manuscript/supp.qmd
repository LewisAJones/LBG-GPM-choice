# Supplementary Text

Here, we test the sensitivity of deep-time Latitudinal Biodiversity Gradient (LBG) reconstructions to the use of different Global Plate Models (GPMs).

GPMs use the Euler Rotation Theorem to reconstruct the motion of tectonic plates on a sphere-like structure–the Earth. Based on a compilation of geological data (see [@seton2023] for an extensive review), a GPM divides tectonic plates into smaller sub-units that will move relatively to each other in a hierarchical way. It therefore takes two main inputs: (1) a set of tectonic elements and (2) a tree-like structured framework in which these elements moved throughout the geological times, called reference frame [@seton2023; @verard_plate_2019; @ross_hierarchical_1988]. Two classes of GPMs exist. ‘Continental-drift’ models are modelling the motion of present-day continental sub-units by treating them as static sub-units [e.g. @wright2013; @scotese2018], whereas ‘full-plates’ model describe in detail how plate borders have evolved through geological times [e.g. @gurnis_plate_2012; @seton2012].

We chose three mantle reference frame models, as better-suited for reconstructing palaeolatitudes than other reference frames (see [1]).
